# 🧐 About Me

Hi there! I am a Research Assistant in Computational Social Science Research Center at Zhejiang University, under the supervision of<a href='https://person.zju.edu.cn/chaowu'> Prof. Chao Wu</a>. I completed my master’s degree in Human-Computer Interaction at Xi'an Jiaotong Liverpool University（The University of Liverpool） in March 2024, advised by <a href='https://yulingyun.com/'>Prof. Lingyun Yu</a>. and <a href='https://scholar.xjtlu.edu.cn/en/persons/ChengtaoJi'>Dr. Chengtao Ji</a>.

I am currently very interested in **human-computer interaction, particularly in Human-AI Interaction and Human-LLM Interaction.** I am honored to be mentored by <a href='https://yucheng.gold/'>Dr. Yucheng Jin</a>  in this field. Additionally, I still have some interest in 3D Vision. ***If you are interested in any form of collaboration, please  don’t hesitate to drop me an email or call me directly at +86 13912780195(same for Wechat)***.
